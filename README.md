# Stock-Price-Prediction
Initially there are three mains teps to follow the stock price prediction.
Step-1:

Open google colab and open new notebook. Initially we want to add a file which is empty file and name it as app.py and paste all the code in the file. 

Step-2

For an web application process we are using streamlit app which contains a three line of code i.e
! pip install streamlit -q
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
! streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
These are the three line of code to to open a streamlit web application. First line denotes to install streamlit and second line denotes to get an address and third line denotes the link.

Step-3:

By opening the link paste the address and run it. we will get an perfect web application.
